# Fraction Converter

ðŸŽ¯ Problem: Write a function that takes a number as its argument and returns a string representing that number's simplified fraction.

`Example: NumberToFraction(0.5) === '1/2'`

ðŸ“– Rules:

- Whole numbers and mixed fractions should be returned as irregular fractions.

`Example: NumberToFraction(3.0) === '3/1'`
`Example: NumberToFraction(2.5) === '5/2'`

- Use whichever coding language you feel comfortable using
- The naming convention and complexity of the code is up to you

ðŸ§  Extra Challenge:

- Create tests for your logic

âš¡ Test Coverage:

* Run the following commands to generate custom test coverage report:

  * `npm run test`
  * `npm run generate-report`

  *This will create an html file where you can see the time and space necessary to run each test as well as a coverage directory with a Jest specific html file showing test coverage*
